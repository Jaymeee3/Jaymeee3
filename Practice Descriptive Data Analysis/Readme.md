# Data Analysis Practice with R and MySQL

Welcome to my repository where I practice descriptive data analysis using **R** and **MySQL**. In this repository, you will find a collection of exercises and projects that demonstrate my approach to data analysis, data manipulation, and visualization.

## Description

This repository contains various exercises focused on performing descriptive data analysis using two powerful tools:
1. **R**: Used for statistical analysis and data visualization.
2. **MySQL**: Used for querying relational databases and performing operations on large datasets.

The goal of these exercises is to practice real-world scenarios, data cleaning, exploration, and the use of various statistical techniques to extract meaningful insights from data.

## Technologies Used

- **R**: R programming language, widely used for statistical computing and graphics.
  - Packages: `tidyverse`, `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `tidyr`, `readr`, etc.
- **MySQL**: A popular relational database management system used to query, manage, and manipulate data.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following folders:

- `/R`: Contains R scripts for data analysis and visualization.
- `/MySQL`: Contains SQL queries and scripts for working with relational databases.
- `/ds`: Sample datasets used for the R exercises.
- `/ds - mydemo`: Sample datasets used for the MySQL exercises.

## How to Use

To get started with the exercises:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
   ```
   
2. Navigate to the folder containing R scripts or MySQL queries you want to explore:
   ```bash
   cd /R  # or /MySQL
   ```

3. For R:
   - Install the necessary R packages:
     ```R
     install.packages(c("dplyr", "ggplot2", "tidyr", "readr"))
     ```
   - Run the R scripts directly in your R environment.

4. For MySQL:
   - Import the `.sql` files into your MySQL environment and run the queries to see the results.

5. Review the outputs, tweak the scripts to your needs, and feel free to contribute with your own exercises or improvements.
