      The test consists of several tasks – complete as many as possible.<br>
      Complete the R section of the test in an Rmarkdown file. Submit the compiled Rmarkdown file in HTML format.
    </p>

    <h3 style="color: darkblue;">Task Information:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Some tasks may depend on the results of previous ones;</li>
      <li>Copy the number and description of each task before starting, to clearly indicate which task you are working on;</li>
      <li>The code must be commented, as the interpretation of the results is part of the evaluation. Comments are also useful because, even if the expected results are not achieved, it will be possible to assess how close the solution was.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 style="color: darkblue;">R Section – Task List</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Import the dataset <code>smartphone.csv</code> (Note: the separator is a comma), which contains information about smartphones. Refer to the metadata. Create a copy of the dataset and name it <code>smart</code>.</li>

      <li>Clean up the dataset before starting. Rename variables that contain a period (e.g., <code>price.USD.</code>) so they are separated by an underscore and written in lowercase (Hint: you can rename them one by one using the <code>rename</code> function).</li>

      <li>Check that the data types of the imported variables have been correctly recognized, and explain which variables require type casting.</li>

      <li>Calculate the average weight of smartphones by brand (variables <code>brand</code> and <code>weight.g.</code>) and the standard deviation. Comment on the most interesting results.</li>

      <li>Based on the table created in task 4, graphically represent the average weight of smartphones by brand using a bar chart.</li>

      <li>Create a ranking of the 5 most expensive smartphones from the Huawei brand.</li>

      <li>It is assumed that whether a smartphone supports 8k video recording (variable <code>video_8k</code>) affects the final price (variable <code>price.USD.</code>). Represent the relationship between the variables and comment (Hint: <code>video_8k</code> is a categorical variable).</li>

      <li>Try to replicate the visualization using only smartphones that cost more than $500. Comment.</li>
    </ol>
