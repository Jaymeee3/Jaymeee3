<p>
      The test consists of several tasks: try to complete as many as possible.
      Complete the R part of the test using an RMarkdown file. Submit the compiled RMarkdown file in HTML format.
   </p>

    <h3 style="color: darkblue;">Task Information</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Some tasks may depend on the results of previous ones.</li>
      <li>Before solving a task, copy and paste its number and full description to indicate which task you're working on.</li>
      <li>Code must be commented, as the interpretation of results is part of the evaluation. Comments are also helpful in case the code does not produce the expected results: partial understanding and reasoning will still be assessed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 style="color: darkblue;">R Test – List of Tasks</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Import the dataset <code>smartphone.csv</code> (note: comma-separated), which contains information about movies and TV series available on different streaming platforms (see metadata). Create a copy of the dataset named <code>smart</code>.</li>

      <li>The dataset needs some cleaning before use. Rewrite the last two lines of code into a single block using the tidyverse programming paradigm (i.e., with pipelines) and execute it. If you cannot, simply run the code as provided.</li>

      <pre><code>#names(smart) = str_to_lower(names(smart))

# rewrite the code below:
#smart = smart %>% select(-resolution)

#smart = smart %>% rename(ram_gb = ram.gb.,
#                         weight_g = weight.g.,
#                         storage_gb = storage.gb.,
#                         price_usd = price.usd.)
</code></pre>

      <li>Check whether the data types of the imported variables are correct, and explain which variables would require type casting.</li>

      <li>Create a new categorical variable named <code>ram_cat</code> with the following levels: 0–4GB, 5–8GB, and >8GB, based on the <code>ram_gb</code> variable, which indicates the RAM of the smartphone. Make sure the new variable has the correct data type.</li>

      <li>Create a table of absolute and relative frequencies for the new variable, and plot the absolute frequencies.</li>

      <li>Which brand is the cheapest smartphone? And which one is the most expensive?</li>

      <li>It is assumed there may be a relationship between battery power (<code>battery</code>) and smartphone weight (<code>weight_g</code>). Create a plot showing the relationship between the two variables and comment. (Hint: they are both numeric variables.)</li>

      <li>Try to replicate the same visualization for Apple smartphones only. Comment on the results.</li>
